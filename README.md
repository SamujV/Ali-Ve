# Ali Ve Project 🌸

Welcome to the Ali Ve project repository! This project aims to enhance user interaction at the Cali Botanical Garden. Ali Ve is a 3D-printed flower designed to open upon user touch, accompanied by soothing music. Simultaneously, LEDs embedded in the flower illuminate. After this interaction, the flower gracefully closes.

## Features 🌼
- Touch-sensitive: Opens upon user contact.
- Audio Feedback: Plays relaxing music during interaction.
- LED Illumination: Lights up LEDs for a delightful visual experience.
- Environmental Sensors: Monitors temperature and humidity.
- Cloud Integration: Sends sensor data to Ubidots platform.
- Ubidots Control: Manage Ali Ve remotely via Ubidots platform.

## How it Works 🌱
1. **User Interaction:**
   - Touch Ali Ve to initiate the interaction.
